# rmfb-tech-draft
A draft for the paper/project of finding reused manuscript and printed codex fragments in the bindings of other codices.  Basically, used books fixing and protecting other books.

A main thing here will be linking to the smaller sub-projects, bringing in the best-working parts, and putting together the different models that will be trained on the dataset. Also, a link to the repo for the draft paper to be submitted to the journal, Fragmentology.

### Finding and Extracting Document Images, Making them Ingestible

This has an initial presentation and short paper introducing the proof-of-concept of the project.

### Tweaking Classifications, Classification Definitions, and Reasoning

This was originally set up as an HTML document. However, balancing time spent and the completeness and quality of the instructions dictated PDF documents created from Word bases, as well as some markdown, to give shorter and simpler definitions and guides.
